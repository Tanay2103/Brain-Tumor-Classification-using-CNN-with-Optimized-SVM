Abstract

Effective brain tumor classification is critical for timely and accurate diagnosis, enabling improved treatment outcomes. In this study, we present a novel, hybrid model pipeline that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction with an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM), tuned using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to classify MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories. CNNs, known for their ability to capture intricate spatial patterns in medical images, were employed to extract robust feature representations, while the PSO-optimized SVM was leveraged to enhance classification accuracy by fine-tuning critical hyperparameters; C and gamma. Our approach demonstrated significant improvements in classification performance, with the model achieving a test accuracy of 99.77% after enhancing the generalizability by introducing data augmentation and reducing overfitting by adding dropout layers and early stopping to the CNN model. Moreover, the optimized model achieved a near-perfect Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.9978 underscoring its strong discriminatory power. Metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation results further confirmed the robustness and consistency of the model in distinguishing between tumor and non-tumor images. These findings validate the potential of integrating deep learning with bio-inspired optimization techniques for high-precision brain tumor classification. This work lays the foundation for further advancements in automated diagnostic systems, potentially augmenting clinical decision-making and patient care.
