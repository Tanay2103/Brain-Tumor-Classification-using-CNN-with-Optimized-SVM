Abstract

Brain and central nervous system (CNS) cancers remain a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, presenting significant diagnostic challenges due to their aggressive nature and diverse manifestations. While biopsies are the gold standard for diagnosis, their invasiveness and associated risks necessitate the development of non-invasive, automated tools for accurate and rapid tumor classification. This study introduces a novel hybrid framework integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed model achieves multiclass classification across four tumor categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. The model incorporates data augmentation, dropout layers, pooling, batch-normalization, and hyperparameter tuning via PSO, to enhance generalization and minimize overfitting. Experimental results on the Brain Tumor MRI dataset demonstrate the modelâ€™s robust performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 84.77%, a macro-average F1 score of 0.80, and a macro-average precision of 0.91. The performance of the PSO-optimized CNN-SVM model was benchmarked against traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, which demonstrated mean accuracies between 48% and 72%. The proposed hybrid model significantly surpasses these conventional approaches, establishing its superiority in classification accuracy and reliability. These findings demonstrate the proposed model as a reliable, non-invasive diagnostic tool, with significant potential to improve early detection and treatment planning for brain tumor patients.
